Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,
to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.


s1 - Problem and Data Identification
s2 - EDA and preprocessing
s3 - Model selection(ML/DL),training of the model,testing of the model
s4 - Productionize/ hosting of the solution (reporting)

75% of the time is spend for EDA and preprocessing.

EDA -Exploratory Data Analysis
This is one of the most important steps in Data Analytics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to

	- maximize insight into a data set;
	- uncover underlying structure;
	- extract important variables;
	- detect outliers and anomalies;

for EDA we will be using Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization)

General outline for EDA
1.Preview data - head(),tail(),describe(),info()
2.Check total number of entries and column types -shape,dtypes
3.Check any null values -isna() - identify the methods to remove/replace null values
4.Check duplicate entries - duplicated(),drop_duplicate()
5.Check outlier values - identify the methods to remove/replace outlier values
6.Plot distribution of numeric data (univariate and pairwise joint distribution) - different graphs
7.Plot count distribution of categorical data -histogram/boxplot
8.Analyse time series of numeric data by daily, monthly and yearly frequencies - this is for timeseries data.
